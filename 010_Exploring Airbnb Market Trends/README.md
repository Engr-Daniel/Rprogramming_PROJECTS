# EXPLORING AIRBNB MARKET TRENDS

Apply your importing and cleaning data and data manipulation skills to explore New York City Airbnb data.

## Project Description
New York City has a variety of Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, with several different price levels, room types, and locations.

Practice your skills in importing and cleaning data and data manipulation and report insights to a real estate start-up!


## Project Instructions
As a consultant working for a real estate start-up, you have collected Airbnb listing data from various sources to investigate the short-term rental market in New York. You'll analyze this data to provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.

There are three files in the data folder: `airbnb_price.csv`, `airbnb_room_type.xlsx`, `airbnb_last_review.tsv`.

- What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews?
- How many of the listings are private rooms?
- What is the average listing price for all rooms (rounded to the nearest penny)?

	- Combine these four values into one tibble called `review_dates` with four columns: `first_reviewed`, `last_reviewed`, `nb_private_rooms`, and `avg_price`	. The tibble should only contain one row of values.


**How to approach the project**

1. Load and merge the data

2. Determine the earliest and most recent review dates

3. Finding how many listings are private rooms

4. Finding average price of listings

5. Creating a tibble with the four solution values
