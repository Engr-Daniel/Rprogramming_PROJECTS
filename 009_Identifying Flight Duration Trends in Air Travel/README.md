# IDENTIFYING FLIGHT DURATION TRENDS IN AIR TRAVEL

Exploring flight data from NYC using advanced data joining techniques in R.

## Project Description
Fly into the world of airline data analysis, focusing on flights from NYC in the latter half of 2022. Enhance your data manipulation skills by exploring flight durations, frequencies, and destinations using the 'tidyverse' and gain valuable insights into airline operations.


## Project Instructions
Which airline and airport pair receives the most flights from NYC and what is the average duration of that flight?

- Save your answer as a data frame called `frequent` with one row and a minimum of two columns: `airline_name`, `airport_name`.

Find the airport that has the longest average flight duration (in hours) from NYC. What is the name of this airport?

- Save your answer as a data frame called `longest` with one row and a minimum of two columns: `airline_name`, `airport_name`.

Which airport is the least frequented destination for flights departing from JFK?

- Save your answer as a character string called `least`.


**How to approach the project**
1. Complex data joining and summarization

2. Finding the most frequent flight destination

3. Determining the longest flight duration

4. Discovering the least common destination
