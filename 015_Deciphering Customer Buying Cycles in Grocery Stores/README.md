Analyze grocery store data to identify shopping patterns and preferences.

## Project Description
Analyze grocery store transactions to optimize retail strategies for a local chain. Dive two grocery store s' data including date and time information. Explore customer behavior by examining purchase times, quantities, and product preferences. Utilize the `tidyverse` for data manipulation and uncover trends in shopping habits.

## Project Instructions
- In order to understand consumer spending patterns, what week of the year during the time period given (June 1 to August 31) had the smallest absolute deviation in sales value compared to the mean weekly sales over that same time period? Enter your answer into the `smallest_sales_deviation` object as an integer.

- In order to tailor marketing strategies, what hour of the day (as a number on the 24 hour scale) had the most hourly total sales? Enter your answer into the `most_hourly_sales` object as an integer.

- In order to evaluate individual buying preferences, how many days went by between the three purchases of cornflakes by `CustomerID 107`? Enter your answer into the `cornflakes_days` object as an integer vector in the format `c(num1, num2)` where num1 is the number of days between the first purchase and the second and num2 for the second and third purchases.
