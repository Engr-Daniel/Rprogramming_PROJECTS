1. ## [Dr. Semmelweis and the Importance of Handwashing](https://github.com/Engr-Daniel/Rprogramming_PROJECTS/tree/master/001_Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Importance%20of%20Handwashing)

In this project, I reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing and its impact on the hospital and I answer the question how much did handwashing reduce monthly death rates on average.

This project will sharpen your skills on:
- Working with tidyverse library, 
- Data manipulation 
- Data Visualization
- Setting threshold with date datatype
- Interpreting insight from Visualization
- Summarize data with mean and grouping
